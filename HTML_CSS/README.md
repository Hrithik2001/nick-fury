In this Project I developed a webiste on beautiful places to visit using HTML,CSS and Bootstrap as a framework.

I have created only a part of website due to time constraints. You can see how it will
be under Asia Tab in The Project. In the same way with slight modifications the other
tabs will be. As mentioned ude to time constraints the remaining tabs will direct to 
some articles for tourism for the respective places mentioned.

The Index Page Consists of Different naturally beautiful places int the world which are divided into categories based on their place of origin
i.e., Continents which are sub divided into countries and places they situated.There is also a link provided for signup/login and about page
redirects to a resume page of mine(My first website created from scratch) which describes all about me briefly.

The index page also has some cards that redirects users to the respective links like buying a book, read about species thorugh wikipedia etc and there is 
a suggestions tab where you can help us to give some ideas on how to make website more user-friendly and complaints can be posted. At the footer we have 
different places with links provided about them.

In this project as I have mentioned above I have developed only asia tab which has two sub categories India and japan. In india page you can see different 
places and a link provided about them below the pictures and same has been done in japan page only cards are provided as an extra feature.
